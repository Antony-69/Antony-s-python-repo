## 👋 Hey there!  

I’m **Antony**, a **Computer Science student** at **Lviv IT College** 🇺🇦.  
Currently diving deep into **Python** as part of my course **“Testing Programming Environment”**.  
This repository is where I experiment, learn, and build cool stuff while mastering the art of software testing and clean coding.

A collection of Python scripts, exercises, and projects created while exploring:
- 🧠 Core Python concepts  
- 🧩 Automation & scripting  
- 🧪 Software testing environments
